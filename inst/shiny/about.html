For further details please refer to our <a href="https://www.ohdsi.org/2022showcase-68/">submission to the OHDSI symposium 2022 </a>. However, please note that due to regular updates to the data sources used in this application, some results may differ from previous presentations.

<p>
To preseve patient privacy and ensure robust similarity estimation, available exposure cohorts are limited to those with 1,000 or more subjects.
In addition, covariates with prevalance below 1% are omitted from similarity calculations and their prevalence values are masked in the diagnostic tables.
If you feel any information in this utility may inadvertantly compromise patient privacy, please contact the authors.
